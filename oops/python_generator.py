"""
A generator function is a special type of function that returns an iterator object. Instead of using return to send back a single value, generator functions use yield to produce a series of results over time. 
The function pauses its execution after yield, maintaining its state between iterations.

"""
Why Do We Need Generators?

1. Memory Efficient : Handle large or infinite data without loading everything into memory.
2. No List Overhead : Yield items one by one, avoiding full list creation.
3. Lazy Evaluation : Compute values only when needed, improving performance.
4. Support Infinite Sequences : Ideal for generating unbounded data like Fibonacci series.
5. Pipeline Processing : Chain generators to process data in stages efficiently.

# Simple Generator

def func():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

print("Type for func ", type(func))

for val in func():
    print(val)


"""
Yield vs Return

1. Yield: is used in generator functions to provide a sequence of values over time. 
When yield is executed, it pauses the function, returns the current value and 
retains the state of the function. This allows the function to continue from same point when called again, 
making it ideal for generating large or complex sequences efficiently.

2. Return: is used to exit a function and return a final value. Once return is executed, function is terminated immediately and no state is retained.
 This is suitable for cases where a single result is needed from a function.
